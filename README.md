# Design Patterns

**A Collection of decscriptions, code fragments, links to resources etc. to help understand reusable code patterns**

The goal is to create/collate a useful resource for understanding common code abstractions.  _Patterns_ that can be used and reused to solve commonly occuring problems in coding. 

Large parts of the code and information _are not original content_ and have been found across the web, copied and in many cases modified.  Reference to the original content is provided when still available at the time of writing this.
